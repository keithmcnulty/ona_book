## Notes on data used in this book  {-}

For R and Python users, each of the data sets used in this book can be downloaded individually by following the code in each chapter.  Alternatively, if you intend to work through all the chapters, all data sets can be downloaded in advance by installing the `onadata` package.

For R users, this can be installed as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install onadata package
install.packages("onadata")
library(onadata)

# see a list of data sets
data(package = "onadata")

# find out more about a specific data set ('karate' example)
help(karate)
```

For Python users, use `pip install onadata` to install the package into your environment. Then, to use the package:

```{python, eval = FALSE}
# import onadata package
import onadata as ona
import pandas as pd

# see a list of data sets
ona.list_sets()

# load data into a dataframe
df = ona.karate()

# find out more about a specific data set ('karate' example)
ona.karate().info()
```


## Technical note for R users {-}
This book uses the new native pipe operator `|>` which was introduced in R version 4.1.0.  Users using an older version of R, or who wish to use the alternative pipe operator `%>%` can simply replace this in all code.  However, an appropriate library containing `%>%` will need to be loaded, such as `magrittr`, `dplyr` or `tidyverse`.
