Adding , means walk existed four places every bridge used , must nine total place visits. Since contradicts Euler’s earlier observation walk must involve eight place visits, must conclude walk exist.Euler’s proof first time graph like one Interactive Figure 1.2 used solve problem. solution also involved concepts later become critical study graphs.
