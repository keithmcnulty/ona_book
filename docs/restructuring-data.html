<p>So far we have learned how to define and visualize graphs to allow us to work with them and to gain some basic insights from them. But we have made a really big assumption in doing so. We have assumed that the data we need to create our graph is always available in exactly the form in which we will need it. Usually this is an edgelist or a set of dataframes of edges and vertices. In reality, only certain types of data exist in this form by default. Typically, electronic communication data will often — though not always — have a ‘from’ and ‘to’ structure because that is how communication works and because many of the underlying systems like email, calendar or other communication networks are already built on databases that have a graph-like structure.</p>
<p>In reality, there are a lot of problems where we may want to apply graph theory, but where the data does not exist in an way that makes it easy to create a graph from it. In these cases we will need to transform the data from its existing shape to a graph-friendly shape — a set of vertices and edges.</p>
<p>There are two important considerations in transforming data into a graph-friendly structure. Both of these considerations depend on the problem you are trying to solve with the graph, as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What entities am I interested in connecting? These will be the vertices of your graph. This could be a single entitiy type like a set of people, or it could be multiple entity types, such as connecting people to organizational units. Complex graphs such as those in graph databases will have multiple entity types.</p></li>
<li><p>How do I define the relationship between the vertices. These will be the edges of your graph. Again, there can be multiple relationship types, such as ‘reports to’ or ‘works with,’ depending on how complex your graph needs to be.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to these fundamental considerations, there are also questions of design in how you construct your graph. This is because there is often more than one option for how you can model the entities and relationships you are interested in. For example, imagine that you have two types of relationships where ‘works with’ means that two people have worked together on the same project and ‘located with’ means that two people are based in the same location. One option for modeling these in a single graph is to have a single entity type (people) connected with edges that have a ‘relationship type’ property. Another option is to have several entity types — individuals, projects and locations — as vertices, and to connect individuals to projects and locations using a single edge type that means ‘is a member of.’ In the first option the relationships are modeled directly, but in the second they are modeled indirectly. Both may work equally well for the problem that is being solved by the graph, but one choice may be more useful or efficient than another.</p>
<p>To be able to go about these sorts of transformations requires technical and data design skills and judgment. There is no ‘one size fits all’ solution. The transformations required and how you go about them depends a great deal on the context and the purpose of the work. Nevertheless, in this chapter we will demonstrate two examples which reflect common situations where data needs to be transformed from a graph-unfriendly to a graph-friendly structure. Working through these examples should illustrate a simple design process to follow and help demonstrate typical data transformation methods that could be applied in other common situations.</p>
<p>In the first example, we will study a situation where data exists in traditional rectangular tables, but where we need to transform it in order to understand connections that we cannot understand directly from the tables themselves. This is extremely common in practice and many organizations perform these sorts of transformations in order to populate graph databases from more traditional data sources. In the second example, we will study how to extract information from documents in a way that helps us understand connections between entities in those documents. This is another common situation that has strong applications in general, but has particular potential in the fields of law and crime investigation. Both these examples will be demonstrated in detail using R, and the last section of the chapter will provide guidance for performing similar transformations using Python.</p>

<p>In this example we are going to use some simplified tables from the <em>Chinook</em> database - an open source database which contains records of the customers, employees and transactions of a music sales company. We will be working with four simplified tables from this database which you can load from the <code>onadata</code> package now or download from the internet as follows:</p>

</h3>
<p>First, let’s take a look at a simple example of a graph that already exists explicitly in one of these data tables. Let’s take a look at a few rows of the <code>chinook_employees</code> data set.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb211"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/head.html">head</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">chinook_employees</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##   EmployeeId FirstName LastName ReportsTo
## 1          1    Andrew    Adams        NA
## 2          2     Nancy  Edwards         1
## 3          3      Jane  Peacock         2
## 4          4  Margaret     Park         2
## 5          5     Steve  Johnson         2
## 6          6   Michael Mitchell         1</code></pre>
<p>We can see straight away that we can easily create a graph of the management relationships using this table. In such a graph, we would have a single entity type (the employee) as the vertices and the management relationship (‘is a manager of’) as the edges. For simplicity. let’s use first names as vertex names. By joining our data on itself, using <code>EmployeeId = ReportsTo</code>, we can create two columns with the first names of those in each management relationship.</p>

<p>We can see that the <code>FirstName.x</code> column is the manager and so should be the <code>from</code> column and the <code>Firstname.y</code> column should be the <code>to</code> column in our edgelist. We should also remove rows were there is no edge.</p>

<p>Let’s now try to build a graph based an a slightly more complex definition of connection. We are going to connect Chinook’s customers based on whether or not they share the same support rep. First, let’s take a look at the <code>customers</code> table.</p>

<p>We see a <code>SupportRepId</code> field which corresponds to the <code>EmployeeId</code> field in the <code>chinook_employees</code> table. We can join these tables to get an edgelist of customers to support rep. Let’s also create full names for better reference.</p>

<p>Now we have an option of creating two types of graphs. First we could create a graph from the data as is, using the <code>CustomerName</code> and <code>RepName</code> as the edgelist, and where the relationship is ‘is a customer of.’ Let’s create that graph, and view it in Figure <a href="restructuring-data.html#fig:cust-rep">5.2</a>. We see a tripartite graph with a hub-and-spoke shape.</p>

<p>Recall our original objective is to connect customers if they have the same support rep. It is possible to use this graph to do this indirectly, applying the logic that customers are connected if there is a path between them in this graph. However we may wish to ignore the support reps completely in our graph and make direct connections between customers if they share the same support rep. To do this we need to do some further joining to our previous <code>cust_reps</code> dataframe.</p>
<p>If we join this dataframe back to our <code>chinook_customers</code> dataframe, we can get customer to customer connections via a common support rep as follows:</p>

<p>Now we have a network edgelist we can work with, and we have <code>RepName</code> available to use as an edge property. Note that relationships will appear in both directions in this dataset, but we can take care of that by choosing to represent them in an undirected graph. Let’s build and visualize the graph, as in <a href="restructuring-data.html#fig:cust-cust">5.3</a>. We see a tripartite graph consisting of three complete subgraphs with the edges color coded by the support rep.</p>

<p>To illustrate a further layer of complexity in reshaping data for use in graphs, let’s imagine that we want to connect customers on the basis of them purchasing common products. We may wish to set some parameters to this relationship - for example a connection might be based on a minimum number of common products purchased, to give us flexibility around the definition of connection.</p>
<p>To do this we will need to use three tables - <code>chinook_customers</code>, <code>chinook_invoices</code> and <code>chinook_items</code>. To associate a given customer with a purchased item, we will need to join all three of these tables together. Let’s take a quick look at the latter two.</p>

<p>We can regard the <code>TrackId</code> as an item, and using a couple of joins we can quickly match customers with items. It is possible that customers may have purchased the same item numerous times, but we are not interested in that for this work and so we just need the distinct customer and track pairings.</p>

<p>We can see from looking at this graph that there are a large number of items that only one customer has purchased. Therefore the items themselves seem to be extraneous information for this particular use case. If we are not interested in the items themselves, we can instead create the connections between customers directly. In a similar way to the previous problem, we can join the <code>cust_item</code> table on itself to connect customers based on common item purchases, and we should remove links between the same customer.</p>

<p>The issue with this data set is that it will count every instance of a common item purchase twice, with the customers in opposite orders, and this is double counting. So we need to group the pairs of customers irrelevant of their order and ensure we don’t double up on items.</p>

<p>If we wish, we can restrict the definition of connection. For example, we may define it as ‘purchased at least two items in common,’ as in Figure <a href="restructuring-data.html#fig:cust-item-two">5.6</a>. We can use the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/igraph/man/subgraph.html">subgraph()</a></code> function in <code>igraph</code> for this, and the result reveals a bipartite graph that looks quite symmetrical, indicating that there appears to be two independent groups of customers who have some overlap in purchasing behavior.</p>

<p>In our second example, we will look at how to extract information that sits in semi-structured documents and convert it to a graph-like shape to allow us to understand relationships that interest us. Semi-structured documents are documents which have a certain expected format through which we can reliably identify important actors or entities. These could be legal contracts, financial statements or other types of structured forms. Through extracting entities from these documents, we can identify important relationships between them, such as co-publishing, financial transactions or contractual obligations.</p>
<p>To illustrate this we will show how to extract information from a TV script in a way where we can determine which characters have spoken in the same scene together, and then use this information to create a network of TV characters. We will use an episode script from the hit TV comedy show <em>Friends</em>. A full set of scripts from all episodes of <em>Friends</em> can be found online at <code>https://fangj.github.io/friends/</code>, and later in this book we will be working with a substantial network of characters from the entire series. For this exercise, however, we will keep it simple and just focus on the character network from the first episode. The script of the first episode can be found at <code>https://fangj.github.io/friends/season/0101.html</code>.</p>

</h3>
<p>First we will look at how to obtain a list of numbered scenes and the characters in each scene, through ‘scraping’ these details from the online script. To help us with this we will use the <code>rvest</code> R package, which is designed for scraping information from web pages.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the web code for Season 1 Episode 1. You can do this by opening the script webpage in Google Chrome and then pressing CMD+Option+C (or Ctrl+Shift+C in Windows) to open the Elements Console where you can view the HTML code of the page side-by-side with the page itself.</p>
<p>One of the things we can see immediately is that most of the words that precede a colon are of interest to us. In fact, most of them are character names that say something in a scene. We also see that lines that contain the string “Scene:” are pretty reliable indicators of scene boundaries.</p>
<p>The first thing we should do is get this HTML code in a list or vector of nodes which represent the different pieces of formatting and text in the document. Since this will contain the separated lines spoken by each character, this will be really helpful for us to work from. So let’s download the HTML code and break it into nodes so that we have a nice tidy vector of script content.</p>

<p>This has generated a names character vector that contains a lot of different split out parts of the script, but most importantly it contains the lines from the script, for example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb260"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">nodes</span><span class="op">[</span><span class="fl">16</span><span class="op">]</span></code></pre></div>

## "[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are there.]"</code></pre>
<p>Now, to generate something useful for our task, we need to create a vector that contains the word ‘New Scene’ if the line represents the beginning of a scene, and the name of the character if the line represents something spoken by a character. This will be the best format for what we want to do.</p>
<p>The first thing we will need to do is swap any text string containing “Scene:” to the string “New Scene.” We can do this quite simply using an <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/ifelse.html">ifelse()</a></code> on the nodes vector, where we use <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/grep.html">grepl()</a></code> to identify which entries are in nodes that contain the string “Scene:”</p>

<pre><code>## [1] 15</code></pre>
<p>That worked nicely. Now, you might also have noticed that, for dialogue purposes, character names precede a colon at the beginning of a line. So that might be a nice way to extract the names of characters with speaking parts in a scene (although it might give us a few other things that have preceded colons in the script also, but we can deal with that later).</p>
<p>So what we will do is use regular expression syntax (regex) to tell R that we are looking for anything at the beginning of a line preceding a colon. We will use a lookahead regex string as follows: <code>^[A-Za-z ]+(?=:)</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s look at that string and make sure we know what it means. The <code>^[A-Za-z ]+</code> component means ‘find any sub-string of alphabetic text of any length including spaces at the beginning of a string.’ The part in parentheses <code>(?=:)</code> is known as a lookahead — it means look ahead of that sub-string of text and find situations where a colon is the next character. This is therefore instructing R to find any string of alphabetic text at the start of a line that precedes a colon and return it. If we use the R package <code>stringr</code> and its function <code><a href="https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_extract.html">str_extract()</a></code> with this regex syntax, it will go through every entry of the <code>nodes</code> vector and transform it to just the first string of text found before a colon. If no such string is found it will return an <code>NA</code> value. This is great for us because we know that, for the purpose of dialogue, characters names are always at the start of nodes, so we certainly won’t miss any if we just take the first instance in each line. We should also, for safety, not mess with the scene breaks we have put into our vector.</p>

<p>So this is working, but we have more cleaning to do. For example, we will want to get rid of the <code>NA</code> values. We will also see if we take a look that there is a ‘character’ called ‘All’ which probably should not be in our network. We can also see phrases like ‘Written by’ which are not dialogue characters, and strings containing " and " which involves combinations of characters. So we can create special commands to remove any instances of these phrases<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;The limited cleaning commands here work for this specific episode, but they would need to be expanded to be used on more episodes to take into account any unpredictable formatting in the scripts.

<p>Let’s assume our cleaning is done and we have a nice vector that contains either the names of characters that are speaking lines in the episode or “New Scene” to indicate that we are crossing a scene boundary. We now just need to convert this vector into a simple dataframe with two columns for scene and character. We already have our character lists, so we really just need to iterate through our nodes vector and for each entry, count the number of previous occurrences of “New Scene” and add one.</p>

<p>Then we can finalize our dataframe by putting our two vectors together and removing any repeated characters in the same scene. We can also correct for situations where the script starts with a New Scene and we can consistently format our character names to title case, to account for different case typing.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">5.2.2</span> Creating an edgelist from the scraped data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-an-edgelist-from-the-scraped-data"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Now we have scraped the data of characters who have spoken in each numbered scene, we can now try to build an edgelist between characters based on whether they have both spoken in the same scene. We can also consider adding a weight to each edge based on the number of scenes in which both characters have spoken.</p>
<p>To do this, we will need to generate a set of unique pairs from the list of characters in each scene. To illustrate, let’s look at the characters in Scene 11:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb271"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">scene11_chars</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="va">results</span> |&gt; 
  <span class="fu">dplyr</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html">filter</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">scene</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="fl">11</span><span class="op">)</span> |&gt; 
  <span class="fu">dplyr</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pull.html">pull</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">character</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] "Rachel"   "Chandler" "Joey"     "Monica"   "Paul"</code></pre>
<p>The unique pairs from this scene are formed by starting with the first character in the list and pairing with each of those that follow, then starting with the second and pairing with each that follows, and so on until the final pair is formed from the second-to-last and last elements of the list. So for Scene 11 our unique pairs would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Rachel pairs:</strong> Rachel-Chandler, Rachel-Joey, Rachel-Monica, Rachel-Paul</li>
<li>
<strong>Chandler pairs:</strong> Chandler-Joey, Chandler-Monica, Chandler-Paul</li>
<li>
<strong>Joey pairs:</strong> Joey-Monica, Joey-Paul</li>
<li>
<strong>Monica pairs</strong>: Monica-Paul</li>
</ul>
<p>So we should write a function called <code>unique_pairs()</code> which accepts a character vector of arbitrary length and forms pairs progressively in this way. Then we can apply this function to every scene.</p>

<p>Now let’s test our new function on the Scene 11 characters:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb274"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu">unique_pairs</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">scene11_chars</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>

<p>That looks right. Now we can easily generate our edgelist from this episode by applying our new function to each scene.</p>

<p>This looks like it worked. Now we can just count the number of times each distinct pair occurs in order to get our edge weights (making sure to ignore the order of the characters).</p>

<p>We can now use this edgelist to create an undirected network graph for the first episode of <em>Friends</em>.

<p>To repeat the work in Section <a href="restructuring-data.html#doc-transform">5.2</a> in Python, we will use the <code>BeautifulSoup</code> package to scrape our web script of the first episode of <em>Friends</em>.</p>

<p>The object <code>friends_ep1</code> contains all the HTML code of the script web page. Now we need to look for the string <code>Scene:</code> and replace it with the string <code>&lt;b&gt;New Scene:&lt;/b&gt;</code>. It should be clear soon why we should put the replacement string in bold HTML tags.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb282"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb282-1"><a href="restructuring-data.html#cb282-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>originalString <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"Scene:"</span></span>

<p>Now we know from viewing the web page or inspecting the HTML code that the characters’ names who are speaking in scenes will be inside bold or strong HTML tags, so firstly lets get everything that is in bold or strong tags in the document, and then let’s match for any alphabetic string (including spaces) prior to a colon using regular expression syntax. This should include the <code>New Scene</code> tags that we created in the last step.</p>

<li>What are the two most important things to define when you intend to transform data into a graph-friendly structure?</li>
<li>Imagine that you are working in a global Law firm with a database that has three tables. One table lists employee location details including office and home address. A second table includes details on which clients each employee has been working for and what specialty areas they focus on with each client. A third table lists the education history of each employee including school and major/subject area. List out all the different ways you can think to turn this data into a graph.</li>
<li>Pick one or two of your answers from Question 3 and write down two options for how to structure a graph for each of them. For one option, consider a graph where employees are the only vertices. Then consider a graph where there are at least two different entity types as vertices.<br>
</li>
<li>Considering your answers to Question 4, how might your edges be defined in each of your options? Would the edges have any properties?
For the examples in Questions 6-10, discuss ways that information could be extracted, reshaped and loaded into a graph in order to serve a useful analytic purpose.<br>

This data contains the reviews of a collection of Yelp users on dog parks in the Phoenix, Arizona area.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create an edgelist and vertex set that allows you to build a graph showing both the parks and the users as entity types. Include the <code>stars</code> rating as an edge property and ensure that entity types are distinguishable in your data.</li>
<li>Use your edgelist and vertex set to create a graph object that has edge and vertex properties.</li>
<li>Visualize your graph in a way that differentiates between users and parks. Use your visualization to point out users that have reviewed numerous dog parks.</li>
<li>Generate a subgraph consisting only of edges where the <code>stars</code> rating was 5. Repeat your visualization for this subgraph. Use it to identify a frequently 5-star rated park. Has any user reviewed more than one park as 5-star rated?</li>

<li>Repeat the steps in Section <a href="restructuring-data.html#doc-transform">5.2</a> to scrape this webpage to obtain a list of scenes and characters speaking in each scene. Watch out for any additional cleaning that might be necessary for this script compared to the Episode 1 script.</li>
<li>Use the methods in Section <a href="restructuring-data.html#doc-transform">5.2</a>, including the <code>unique_pairs()</code> function, to create an edgelist for the character network for Episode 2 with the same edge weight based on the number of scenes the characters both spoke in.</li>
<li>Create a graph for Episode 2 and visualize the graph.</li>
<li>Combine the edgelist for both Episodes 1 and 2 by adding the weights for each character pair, and then create and visualize a new graph that combines both episodes.</li>
<li>
<strong>Extension:</strong>. Try to wrap the previous methods in a function that creates an edgelist for any arbitrary <em>Friends</em> episode found at <code>https://fangj.github.io/friends/</code>. Add additional cleaning commands for unexpected formatting that you might see in different scripts.</li>
<li>
<strong>Extension:</strong>. Try to run your function on all Season 1 episodes of <em>Friends</em> and use the results to create and visualize a graph of the character network of the entire first season.</li>
